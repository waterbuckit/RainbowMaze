# RainbowMaze

This is my friend's project, which I took and refactored with a focus on making the box-drawing more succinct.
Project still needs better documentation

# Features
* is my only semi-recent java project
* collab project
* **very fancy** `Direction` [class](https://github.com/Akinevz/RainbowMaze/blob/master/src/mazesolver/Direction.java#L6) 
* *and* we have `Wall`s!
* a little lacking on the documentation side
* very simple algorithm
